# üìù Real-Time Voice Transcriber with LiveKit 1. Clone the repo
This repository contains a real-time multilingual voice agent built using LiveKit Agents. The agent demonstrates the core functionality of a voice-based conversational system tailored for Indian SMBs as part of the proPAL AI Backend Engineering Internship task.

üß† Project Objective
Develop a simple, real-time voice agent pipeline that:

Listens to user speech via STT (Speech-to-Text)

Generates a text response using an LLM (Large Language Model)

Responds with natural speech using TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Handles interruptions using VAD and turn detection

Logs conversation metrics like latency and response timings
